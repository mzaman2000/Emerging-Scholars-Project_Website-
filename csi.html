        <h1>Cyber Security Information
        </h1>
        
        <p>The Clark School at the University of Maryland conducted a study that found that
            computers are hacked 2,244 times a day, on average. The study identified that a
            computer is attacked by cybercriminals every 39 seconds. Further, the cybersecurity
            stats section revealed which usernames and passwords are non-secure.
            In other words, 279 days is the amount of time it takes to contain a breach. Basically,
            this equates to more than nine months before an identified data breach can be
            controlled. It goes without saying that this can result in massive losses for affected
            businesses. The faster a breach is contained, the better. However, IBM and
            Ponemon Institute’s study found that it took an average of 206 days to identify a
            threat, while the average time needed to contain it was 73 days.

        <p>In its 2019 Data Breach Investigations Report, Verizon revealed that email was (and
            still is) the top entry point of malware attacks. Sufficient amounts of data on
            malware were carefully analyzed, and it was concluded that more than 90% of the
            attacks had been carried out through email channels. Since emails are essential
            means for day-to-day communication, users must be more vigilant about potentially
            malicious incoming emails.
            Human error is the primary cause of cybersecurity breaches, accounting for 95% of
            all data breaches.This is probably one of the dismal cybersecurity facts. Human
            error in digital security is any unintentional action (or lack of action) by a user
            leading to a security breach. Using generic or weak passwords and downloading
            malicious attachments are just some of the examples of these actions. Therefore,
            the strongest weapon to combat these hacking methods is spreading awareness
            about the importance of practicing digital hygiene.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                94% of malware attacks are carried out through email, as malware statistics 2019
reveal.In its 2019 Data Breach Investigations Report, Verizon revealed that email was
(and still is) the top entry point of malware attacks. Sufficient amounts of data on
malware were carefully analyzed, and it was concluded that more than 90% of the
attacks had been carried out through email channels.
There’s an average fall of 7.27% in stock prices following a breach incident.
Analysis of the closing share prices of 28 New York Stock Exchange-listed
companies showed that these companies hit the lowest point nearly 14 market days
after a breach incident. On average, their share prices fell 7.27%. This also equates
to -4.18% NASDAQ underperformance.
            </p>
            <br>

            <P>6. Data breach statistics 2019 affirm that it takes an average of 206 days for most
                companies to identify a data breach.
                As the working environment becomes more advanced, cybersecurity stratagems
                also get sophisticated and more complex. This makes it harder for companies to
                detect a data breach. By the time a breach is detected, the companies will have been
                exposed for several months and lost a lot.
                7. 49 individuals from different nationalities have been prosecuted for allegedly
                spying on the U.S.
                Besides the indictment of 18 Russia nationals, 19 Chinese organizations or
                individuals, 11 Iranians, and 1 North Korean were charged as well. This shows a
                massive surge in the total number of indictments by U.S. authorities in 2018. These
                state-sponsored criminals employ various techniques to spy on the U.S. with the
                primary purpose of intelligence gathering, which was evident among 96% of groups.
                Their most popular tactics were “living off the land” and using destructive malware.
                8. In line with recent data security statistics, approximately 7 million data records are
                compromised per day.
                In other words, around 80 data records are compromised every single second. This
                approximates to 7 million data records compromised each day. Based on this figure,
                the number of records compromised in a year will be close to 2.55 billion.</P>
                <br>
                <p>
                    According to cyber attacks statistics, small businesses were the main targets of
                    43% of cyber attacks.
                    As large organizations become more knowledgeable about its ins and outs of
                    cybersecurity and learn to invest resources in it, cyber criminals tend to divert their
                    attention toward smaller businesses. Considering the size of small businesses
                    (especially in their early stages of operations), they probably do not deem
                    cybersecurity their top priority, which makes them more vulnerable to internet
                    security threats.
                    10. The U.S. has the highest percentage (18.2%) of ransomware attacks.
                    By definition, ransomware is a type of malicious software that infects computers. It
                    then shows messages asking a user to pay a fee in order for the system to regain
                    functionality. It’s an illegal money-making scheme, and countries with high numbers
                    of the digital population, such as the U.S., are more susceptible to this kind of
                    security threat. Based on recent ransomware statistics, the U.S. recorded the highest
                    number of ransomware attacks — 18.2%.
                    Cyber Crime Statistics Worldwide
                    11. A 300% rise in cybercrime was reported following the COVID-19 outbreak.
                    As more employees have moved their work from office settings to their homes due
                    to COVID-19, hackers took advantage of the opportunity to threaten highly vulnerable
                    networks. Accordingly, the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) observed a
                    skyrocketing of reported cybercrimes since the outbreak of coronavirus. The
                    department’s record reveals that detecting cyber attacks in 2020 has become more
                    challenging since there are now between 3,000 and 4,000 complaints per day. In
                    comparison, before the outbreak, the IC3 received 1,000 complaints per day.
                    12. The number of passwords that both humans and machines use worldwide is
                    estimated to reach 300 billion by 2020.Passwords are essential data associated
                    with accounts, be it personal or business. Several security and account management
                    experts predict that, by 2020, there will be 300 billion passwords used by humans
                    and machines worldwide. Two-thirds of the passwords are expected to be used by
                    machines. Fortunately, all of these passwords will be cyber protected.
                    13. The losses associated with the Business Email Compromise/Email Account
                    Compromise reached over $26 billion from 2016 to 2019.
                    The number of worldwide cyber attacks grows continuously, and so do the
                    associated costs. In a span of just a little over a year (between May 2018 and July
                    2019), identified global losses grew by 100%.Since more people became more aware
                    of the scam, they were prompted to report any identified incident to authorities. This
                    partly contributed to the said increase. Reports from the IC3 show that there were
                    166,349 domestic and international BEC/EAC incidents between June 2016 and July
                    2019.
                    14. The global accommodation industry suffered a total of 125 cyber attacks in
                    2019. The hospitality industry is one of the fastest-growing sectors of the economy,
                    making it an attraction to cybercriminals. Cybersecurity statistics 2019 exhibited
                    that the accommodation industry alone, which is a subdivision of the hospitality
                    industry, incurred a total of 125 cyberattacks in the said year. Marriott International,
                    one of the largest contributors to the hospitality industry market share, experienced
                    the second-largest personal data breach to date. It took more than five years for the
                    company to realize that the personal information of more than half a billion of its
                    properties’ guests has been compromised.
                    15. 38% of malicious email attachments globally were detected in files of MS Office
                    format. Analysis of email telemetry aimed to determine what types of file extensions
                    in emails are usually malicious revealed that files of Microsoft Office format (i.e.,
                    Word, Excel, and PowerPoint) account for 38% of the identified malicious email
                    attachments. That places these files at the top of malicious extensions, along with
                    archives (37%) and PDFs (14%).
                    Cyber Attacks Statistics by Year
                    16. 8,854 breaches have been recorded between 2005 and 2018.
                    Just how many compromised records are there with this number of breaches? The
                    answer is — millions. And how much do these cost? Every record is priced anywhere
                    from $120-$600. Setting the average price per record at $360, the total value of
                    these breaches stands at billions. Sadly, the number of cyber attacks per year grows
                    continuously despite all the sophisticated methodologies that are being developed
                    and deployed to resist them. While most people often talk about the costs
                    associated with cybersecurity, they fail to realize the cost of not investing in it. The
                    latter usually can cost the company more.

                    17. In 2018, enterprise infections increased by 12%, while a decline of 52% was seen
in overall ransomware infections.
The year 2018 saw ransomware activity plummeting for the first time since 2013.
This decline in overall ransomware infections is calculated following the removal of
the most common worms (i.e., WannaCry, Petya, and copycat versions) from
statistics. More consumers now use mobile devices, opting for cloud backup and
lessening their exposure to ransomware threats. However, despite the decline of
overall ransomware infections, statistics on cybersecurity indicate that enterprise
infections accelerated in the same year. These infections mostly affected
businesses, with email campaigns being the primary method of delivery.
18. There has been an increase of 11% in security breaches since 2018.
As new business innovations are introduced, we get to witness the expansion of the
threat landscape as cybercriminals see new opportunities to perform their malicious
activities. A rise of 11% in security breaches was pointed to in 2018 cybersecurity
statistics. Generally speaking, organizations tend to put a premium on introducing
new technological innovations to drive growth at the expense of cybersecurity.
Following this, attackers have a chance to take advantage of the situation.
19. The U.S. experienced a total of 1,473 data breaches in 2019.
This number is the second-highest. So far, the country experienced the most data
breaches in 2017 — 1,632 cases. As more and more companies use digital files and
as users increasingly rely on digital data, a data breach has also leveled up.
Government statistics on cybersecurity growth could clearly attest to this.
Interestingly, the most common type of data breach is identity theft. What’s more, it
is said that identity theft is on the rise now because of COVID-19. Once again, the
reason might lie in moving work-related operations from secure office settings to
incredibly vulnerable home networks.
20. In 2019, about 1 billion web-based cyber attacks were repulsed.
A total of 975,491,360 browser-based attacks located all over the world were kept at
bay in 2019 thanks to Kaspersky’s products. Additionally, the leading provider of
cybersecurity solutions and services worldwide uncovered unique malicious URLs.
Based on the data, the exact number of incidents reported was 273,782,113.
21. Cyber attacks 2020 report indicates a skyrocketing of digital threats, reaching
445 million incidents in the first quarter.A spike in online fraud was experienced in
the first quarter of 2020 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Face-to-face
transactions being restricted across the globe gave rise to digital transactions.
Accordingly, fraud organizations were prompted to move quickly and leverage the
inflation in digital activity. Fraud and abuse attempts comprised 26.5% of all
transactions — the highest cyber-attack rate that Arkose Labs reported. This also
represents a 20% increase over the preceding quarter.
22. Founded on cybersecurity attacks 2020 data, online attacks targeting the WHO
staff increased fivefold since the COVID-19 pandemic started.
The number of cyber threats against the World Health Organization personnel has
dramatically increased toward the end of April after the coronavirus hit. Around 450
active WHO email addresses and passwords were exposed online. This data leakage
did not endanger the organization’s system, but it has caused damage to its older
extranet system. Scammers also continue to target the general public in emails
pretending they’re from WHO to collect donations and channel these through a fake
account instead of the real COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund. This escalated the
number of cyberattacks against the organization fivefold of that in the same period
last year.
Cyber Attacks Stats by Industry
23. Cyber attacks against banks rose by 238% due to COVID-19.
Along with the quick spread of coronavirus across the globe earlier this year, the
skyrocketing of cyber attacks took place, particularly between the months of
February and April. Modern Bank Heists survey found that 80% of the firms polled
said they experienced more cyber threats over the past 12 months.
24. In 2019, the healthcare industry recorded a 75% climb in ransomware attacks.
The figure only included those attacks that were reported to the public, which means
the number could be even higher. The cyber crime statistics 2019 tackle the internet
security aspects of various healthcare institutions, such as hospitals, health
facilities, doctors’ offices, medical consultants, and many more. These organizations
continue to be a favorite of ransomware attacks in recent years.
25. A 78% surge in supply chain attacks was recorded in 2018.
Threats to the supply chain continue to be on the rise, recording an uptick of 78% in
2018. A supply chain attack occurs when a cyber criminal attempts to compromise
their main target using third-party software or services. Attackers continue to target
developers for supply chain threats in several ways, such as injecting malicious code
into authentic software and hacking software updates. Some would compromise
third-party libraries tied to bigger software projects, while others are involved in
credentials theft for version control tools.

                <p>
                    26. Hacking statistics exhibit that 16% of data breaches involved the public sector.
Cyber criminals seem to target almost everyone they can victimize, be it a small
business or a large corporation, a high profile celebrity or just an ordinary individual.
Those who are in the public sector have a higher probability of being attacked since
the sector has the highest breach rate of 16%. The healthcare industry was the
second hardest-hit industry, with 15% of breach incidents recorded. This is expected
given that medical records are highly attractive to attackers. Another desirable target
was the financial industry (10% of breach incidents), given that the majority of cyber
crimes are primarily financially motivated.
27. Cybersecurity statistics 2019 unearth that a malicious email rate at 1 in 323 was
detected in smaller organizations.The said report looked into different email threats,
such as spam, phishing, and email malware. It was found that employees of smaller
organizations (1–250 employees) are more vulnerable to these types of threats.
Approximately 1 in 323 emails are deemed malicious. Conversely, larger
organizations (with 1,001–1,500 employees) display a far lower rate as 1 in 823
emails is considered malicious.
Cybersecurity Stats Based on Attack Type
28. Between January and April 2020, cloud-based attacks escalated by 630%.
Cloud-based attacks originate from external actors whose main aim is to access
cloud accounts and collaboration services, such as Zoom, Slack, Microsoft 365, etc.
McAfee, a cybersecurity company, disclosed in its “Cloud Adoption & Risk Report –
Work-from-Home Edition” that this swelling in cloud-based attacks is correlated with
the rise in the usage of cloud services and collaboration tools. Aside from the
lockdown prompting businesses worldwide to shift toward cloud services, other
significant factors that intensified the number of cloud-based attacks include the
upswing in cloud-native threats and access from unregulated devices.
29. Cybersecurity statistics 2018 disclosed that around 5,200 attacks were
experienced by IoT devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices are smart gadgets built
without considering cybersecurity. This made them very attractive in the eyes of
attackers. Hacked IoT devices can become surveillance gadgets that capture the
credentials of users secretly. In addition, hackers are capable of controlling these
devices to jeopardize performance and usage. A 2018 Symantec research found
that, on average, IoT devices experienced 5,200 attacks per month. This number
almost doubled the reported incidents in 2016, which then stood at 3,650. Moreover,
more than half of organizations (61%) encountered IoT security incidents, the study
claims.
30. Data breaches involving internal actors accounted for 34% of all incidents.
Insider threats are those caused by individuals within an organization. A purely
careless or malicious employee can be an internal actor. It’s quite alarming that the
number of these attackers has been growing steadily since 2015. Verizon disclosed
in its cybersecurity 2019 statistics that nearly 34% of breaches are linked to internal
actors, with 29% involving credentials theft, and 15% originating from authentic
authorized users. Given that, businesses must prioritize securing their data from
insider threats.
31. A high percentage of remote code execution attacks (90%) is related to crypto
mining. Cryptomining malware was one of the top web application attacks observed
in early 2018, involving about 90% of all remote code execution threats. This
malware attack occurs when an attacker tries to execute malicious code through a
network connection from a remote server. This script is downloaded and installed
locally on an unsafe machine, allowing the server to mine some cryptocurrencies.
Once infected by a remote code execution attack, the device CPU’s computing power
weakens and becomes unable to perform other tasks required by the user.
32. Web skimming is one of the recent cyber attacks 2019 has seen, surging to
510,000.Cyber attackers become more and more clever in finding ways to threaten
their victims. The use of unique malicious files, such as HTML and scripts, has
grown exponentially in 2019. In its latest report, Kaspersky revealed an outpouring of
web skimmer files. Its web antivirus solution detected 510,000 malicious objects. As
a result, web skimmers placed 10th in the overall ranking of the top 10 malicious
objects caught online.
33. High-risk apps are installed and run in 1 out of 36 mobile devices.
Mobile applications are less often assumed to cause security issues. The truth is,
high-risk apps were found to be installed in 1 out of 36 mobile devices in 2018,
internet security statistics assert. Unfortunately, mobile apps, along with their risks,
are unavoidable. Since most people use mobile devices, be it for personal or
business purposes, installing mobile apps is inevitable. This means catching
malware is also highly likely. It is, therefore, important that these mobile applications
are built with security protection.
34. A whopping growth in file fewer attacks (256%) was recorded over the first half
of 2019. Several other types of threats, such as file-less malware, continue to
prosper in 2019. This type of attack is considered zero-footprint since it does not
write files to disk and thrives only in RAM. Since file less attacks do not require the
installation of new software on a user’s computer, they’re often overlooked by
antivirus tools. Ponemon Institute’s cybersecurity attacks statistics entitled “The
State of Endpoint Security Risk Report” divulged that file attacks were estimated to
have higher success rates by ten times compared to file-based attacks.
35. About 60% of malicious domains are linked to spam campaigns.
About one-fifth of the malicious domains were linked to malvertising campaigns,
according to cybersecurity statistics. These campaigns usually direct users to utilize
kits; some of them spread ransomware. Malvertising campaigns are created using
several well-worn, domain-related techniques (i.e., domain shadowing). This
technique allows cybercriminals to steal authentic domain account credentials and
subsequently build subdomains at malicious servers. Other cybercriminals would
create malicious domains and subdomains by taking advantage of free, dynamic
DNS services. They would exploit compromised public sites or infected computers
by changing hosting IPs repeatedly to distribute payloads.
36. Cybersecurity statistics concluded that phishing is the number one type of social
engineering attack, which accounts for 80% of reported security incidents.
An increasingly sophisticated form of cyber attack, phishing, lets threat actors use
fraudulent websites and emails to collect personal data. It comprised about 80% of
reported security incidents, making it the number one type of social engineering
attack.Attackers aim to deceive recipients of an email by making it appear legitimate
and desirable, directing recipients to download an attachment or click a link.
Examples of this type of email include bank requests or a note from someone in a
recipient’s company.

                <p>
                    37. 51% of businesses experienced denial of service (DoS) attacks according to
2018 statistics on cybersecurity attacks. As its name implies, Denial-of-Service
(DoS) is a type of cyber attack where the actors try to disrupt, either temporarily or
permanently, the services of an internet host. This makes a network or machine
inaccessible to its users. When a user’s machine or network is flooded by redundant
requests, resulting in system overload and the inability to process legitimate
requests, then it’s likely that the DoS attack has taken place. More than half of
businesses (51%) experienced this type of cyber attack in 2018.
Statistics on Cybersecurity Costs & Spending
38. Information loss is the cyber attack’s most expensive component, valued at $5.9
million. Loss of information is the fastest growing and most expensive result of
cybercrime. Security data show that the cost of information loss or theft is currently
at $5.9 million. The moment sensitive information is compromised or stolen, the
loss of customer’s trust and respect is more than likely to follow, which can
adversely impact the overall operations of the business.
39. In 2019, the costs associated with global cybercrime added up to $2.1 trillion.
Having knowledge of cybersecurity statistics helps improve vigilance as anyone with
a device connected to the internet can fall victim to cyber-attacks. Hackers are not
only interested in targeting large corporations, financial institutions, and celebrities.
They also victimize just about any user. For that reason, global cybercrime costs
amounted to $2.1 trillion in 2019 or 0.80% of the world’s GDP. Following this, it’s
highly expected that cybercrime costs will grow more and more in the years to
come.
40. On average, a malware attack on a company costs $2.6 million.
While the costs of all types of cyberattacks are generally on the rise, malware was
found to be the most expensive of them all. The latest “Cost of Cyber Crime”
research conducted by Accenture disclosed that, in 2018 alone, a single malware
attack costs a company an average of $2.6 million. It also represents an increment
of 11% from 2017 and a 67% increase compared to five years ago. It is evident from
this bit of cybersecurity statistics that malware is among the greatest contributors to
revenue loss.
41. $141 is the average cost of a stolen or lost record for each individual.
In 2017, the Ponemon Institute estimated the average cost per data record at $141,
with the total cost of the global data breach at $3.6 million. This points to a decline
in the average cost when compared with the previous year. However, despite the
reduction, the average size of data breaches went up. The U.S. has significantly
higher data breach costs — amounting to $7.35 million on average.
42. The average cost of a data breach is $3.9 million, cybersecurity stats point out.
Data breach costs vary from country to country and from industry to industry.
However, this can span, in general, anywhere from $1.25 million to $8.19 million.
Currently, the average data breach cost is at $3.9 million, according to the latest
“Cost of a Data Breach” report from IBM and Ponemon Institute. The figure indicates
an uptick of 1.5% from the previous year.
43. Only 9% of SMBs considered cybersecurity a top priority in 2019.
In its survey of 500 SMB’s senior decision-makers, Keeper Security discovered that
the majority of respondents aren’t prepared for cyber threats. In fact, only 9%
consider cybersecurity a top priority for their business. What’s more, statistics on
how small businesses rate their current cybersecurity evidently show the lack of a
cyber attack prevention plan. Surprisingly, almost half of the polled management
group (43%) did not believe a cyber attack was likely to happen. No wonder more
and more SMBs are being targeted by attackers.
44. 50% of cybersecurity budgets are expected to go to security services by 2020.
Since 2018, budgets allotted for cybersecurity have been increasing steadily. It was
that year when security services exceeded other investments for the first time. The
following year, the budget was four times bigger than that of any other services.
Thus, Forrester tagged 2019 as the year for security service. Meanwhile, analysts
from Gartner forecast that 50% of cybersecurity budgets will be allotted for security
services in 2020. This progressive trend in security budgets is among the statistics
showing why cybersecurity matters.
45. By 2021, the projected global spending for cybersecurity stands at $6 trillion.
Cybercrimes grow quickly in size, style, and cost. Following this, the U.S.
Cybersecurity Ventures estimated the annual cost of global crime to reach $6 trillion
by 2021. This is double the amount reported in 2015 ($3 trillion), making it history’s
largest relocation of economic resources. While this could mean putting the
incentives for investment and innovation at risk, more profits are more than likely to
be generated.
Cybersecurity Statistics on Compliance With Cybersecurity Laws
46. Only 50% of companies believed they were compliant with the GDPR in 2018.
Adhering to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law is
mandatory, especially for data centers. However, recent surveys suggest that only
50% of companies affirm they are compliant with the GDPR. Complex changes in
processes and data management technologies are the main reasons for this.
47. Google paid a $57 billion fine to CNIL for non-compliance with GDPR.
Google incurred the largest fine to date due to non-full compliance with GDPR,
cybersecurity facts disclosed. CNIL, a French authority, fined Google €50 million, or
approximately $57 million, for failure to disclose to users its manners of collecting
data across its services, such as Google search engine, Google Maps, and YouTube,
for personalized advertisements. This represents the fourth penalty against the
company since GDPR was first implemented.
48. 31% of consumers noted an improvement in their overall experience with
companies since the implementation of the GDPR.
Marketing Week’s 2019 research uncovered that less than half of the surveyed
consumers, representing only 31%, agree that there’s been an improvement in their
overall experience with companies nearly a year since the GDPR was implemented.
To be fair, brands have exerted their best efforts to be compliant. It’s also worth
noting that 93% of the consumers are somewhat aware of the GDPR’s existence.
Some 39% even confirmed their knowledge of the data law to be of a fair amount.
49. The GDPR fines amounted to $63 million in its first year, according to statistics
on cybersecurity.
To get companies to comply fully with the GDPR’s terms, the data protection
agencies have to impose punishments on non-compliant entities. Fines for
non-compliance can be as high as €20 million, or up to 4% of the annual global
turnover of the previous financial year. With $63 million fines issued in its first year, it
can be concluded that companies have not taken the GDPR law seriously.

                    50. On average, $1.3 million is spent on compliance requirements, and businesses
are expected to put in $1.8 million on top of that.
Compliance with the GDPR law requires companies to spend an average of $1.3
million initially and another $1.8 million additionally. Given that becoming fully
compliant is quite expensive, less than half of the surveyed participants indicate that
they are fully compliant with the GDPR. Also, one in five respondents claim that it’s
truly impossible to become fully compliant, given the complex process and high
costs involved.
51. Statistics on how many businesses invest in cybersecurity conclude that 69%
will allocate some of their budgets for compliance with laws and regulations.
IDG Security Priorities Study 2018 disclosed that more companies (69%) believe that
there’s a strong need for IT security among organizations. Therefore, they are
amenable to allocating some of their budgets for compliance with GDPR. This
investment is seen to bring about positive changes in return. Beneficial effects
include, but are not limited to, a unified policy, streamlined orchestration, and
consistent execution.
Cybersecurity Statistics 2020 & Beyond
52. In March 2020, email scams associated with COVID-19 skyrocketed by more
than 650%.
At this point, we’re already convinced that the coronavirus pandemic has
significantly impacted the cybersecurity sector. This was attested by yet another
type of cyber attack that is COVID-19-themed, whose number has escalated in
March. Barracuda Networks reported that spear-phishing emails linked to COVID-19
soared to a whopping 667% since February.
53. The global cybersecurity market is forecast to reach $173.57 billion by 2022.
In 2012, the cybersecurity market was worth $58.13 billion. With a forecasted
10.35% compound annual growth rate, this figure could reach $173.57 billion in a
few years. Cloud storage develops rapidly, yet, simultaneously opens doors for cyber
attacks and data breaches. Because of this, wireless and endpoint security
implementation becomes highly necessary.
54. Cybersecurity data forecast that by 2023, the use of AI among more than 40% of
privacy compliance technology is expected.
Another development in cybersecurity that is gaining more significance is the
utilization of artificial intelligence, or AI, particularly in privacy compliance and risk
management. In a separate survey, Gartner reflects that more than 40% of privacy
compliance technology will have employed AIs by 2023. This is a strategic move
considering the implementation of increasingly tight laws on security and data
privacy, plus the growing dependence of the cybersecurity industry on AIs.
55. The ecommerce industry is likely to incur at least $25 billion in annual losses due
to online payment fraud by 2024.
This particular part of internet security statistics seems painful for the ecommerce
industry, as it’s expected to suffer from huge losses due to online fraud payment by
2024. The estimated amount of loss will exceed $25 billion, while the growth rate
over the next four years will be at 52%. This was confirmed by Juniper Research in
its “Online Payment Fraud: Emerging Threats, Segment Analysis & Market Forecasts
2020-2024” report.
56. By 2025, there will be 75 billion connected IoT devices.
The IoT market grows increasingly with the rapid expansion of the tech sphere
comprising IoT devices, apps, internet users. Currently, there are more than 5 billion
users with cloud access that can store data on digital devices. It’s expected that
connected IoT devices will reach 31 billion in 2020 and 75 billion by 2025.
