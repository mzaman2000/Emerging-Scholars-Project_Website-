        <p>The Detect Function defines the appropriate activities to identify the occurrence of a
            cybersecurity event. The Detect Function enables the timely discovery of cybersecurity
            events.
            </p>
        
        <p>Examples of outcome Categories within this Function include:
            <br>
            ● Ensuring Anomalies and Events are detected, and their potential impact is
            understood
            <br>
            ● Implementing Security Continuous Monitoring capabilities to monitor
            cybersecurity events and verify the effectiveness of protective measures
            including network and physical activities
            <br>
            ● Maintaining Detection Processes to provide awareness of anomalous events</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                - Anomalies and Events (DE.AE): Anomalous activity is detected in a timely
                manner and the potential impact of events is understood.
                <br>
                - Security Continuous Monitoring (DE.CM): The information system and assets
                are monitored at discrete intervals to identify cybersecurity events and verify
                the effectiveness of protective measures
